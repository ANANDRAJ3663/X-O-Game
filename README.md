# X-O-Game
Remember the X|O game we used to play in our childhood!!
The same game but in the form of code in which two players can play.

Working of the program:
User has to give input for selecting "X" or "O". Then it asks whether you are ready to play the game.
Next the player is given choice to select the location of their inputs ranging from "1-9" in the board.
As soon as the player enter the value it shows the board with the location selected.
Now it's next player turn to select its desired location based on player 1 input.
Similarly this process continues until any one of the player wins.
